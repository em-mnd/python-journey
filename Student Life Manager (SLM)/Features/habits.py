# Daily habits are saved here (add, remove, update, view, complete today)

# Here I store the habit name, the notes according to habits (details about the habit),
# completion status and date created and maybe streak.

# I might filter completed habits for the day and then unmark them the next, but that is for later.
# Weekly completion status might be a good idea to implement as well, but that is for later.
